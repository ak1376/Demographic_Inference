MissingOutputException in rule run_inference in file /sietch_colab/akapoor/Demographic_Inference/Snakefile, line 166:
Job 0 completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
experiments/new_jawn/inferred_params_GHIST_bottleneck.txt (missing locally, parent dir contents: config.json, model_config.json, inference_config_file.json, experiment_obj.pkl, dadi_dict_training.pkl, moments_dict_training.pkl, momentsLD_dict_training.pkl, ground_truth_training.pkl, dadi_dict_validation.pkl, moments_dict_validation.pkl, momentsLD_dict_validation.pkl, ground_truth_validation.pkl, dadi_dict_testing.pkl, moments_dict_testing.pkl, momentsLD_dict_testing.pkl, ground_truth_testing.pkl, rrmse_dict.json, preprocessing_results_obj.pkl, preprocessing_results.png, preprocessing_results_testing.png, linear_mdl_obj.pkl, linear_model_error.json, linear_results.png, linear_regression_model.pkl, features_and_targets.pkl, loss_curves.png, snn_results.png, MLP_model_error.txt, snn_model.pth, snn_results.pkl, dadi_dict_inference.pkl, moments_dict_inference.pkl, momentsLD_dict_inference.pkl, inference_results_obj.pkl)
Removing output files of failed job run_inference since they might be corrupted:
experiments/new_jawn/inference_results_obj.pkl
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
