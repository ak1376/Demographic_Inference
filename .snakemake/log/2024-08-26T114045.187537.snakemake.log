NameError: The name "'--use_FIM' if params" is unknown in this context. Please make sure that you defined that variable. Also note that braces not used for variable access have to be escaped by repeating them, i.e. {{print $1}}, when formatting the following:

        PYTHONPATH={CWD} python {CWD}/snakemake_scripts/setup_trainer.py         --model_config {input.model_config_file}         --experiment_directory {params.experiment_directory}         --features_file {input.features_file}         {'--use_FIM' if params.use_FIM else '--no_use_FIM'}
